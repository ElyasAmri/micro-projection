# Fringe Projection Project — Conversation Summary

> **Companion to PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.** Captures the full history of decisions, hardware identification, theoretical reasoning, and open items from the planning conversation. Read this if you need *why* something was decided, not just *what*.

## 1. The User's Goal

A student/researcher building a **fringe projection 3D measurement system** in a lab. Project supervised by a professor (whose own thesis chapter is the reference material). Deliverables:

1. Python UI for experiment control end-to-end
2. Math/processing pipeline behind the UI
3. Eventually: hardware integration

The user wants to deeply understand the theory and how it maps to hardware **before** writing production code. The conversation has been heavily theoretical for that reason.

## 5. The System Configuration Decision

### How we got there
Initially user asked whether the system was telecentric or not. Through several rounds of clarification:

1. Camera arm telecentric: ✅ confirmed (Edmund Optics lens, hardware-locked)
2. Projector arm: ❌ Pico Genie is not telecentric
3. Future projector: ❓ unknown until hardware arrives
4. Therefore: **HYBRID** is the only honest description
5. Build code for hybrid; it gracefully degrades to symmetric-telecentric if upgraded projector turns out to be telecentric

### Why this matters
- Chapter 2 §2.3.4 derives all math under the **symmetric** non-telecentric assumption (both arms identical)
- Eq. 2-54 (inverse grating period) was derived under that assumption
- For your hybrid system, Eq. 2-54's exact form isn't quite right — but the **method** still works
- The chapter's Eq. 2-54 isn't used directly anyway. **In practice, the inverse pattern is computed from empirical flat-reference calibration**, not from theoretical formulas. This is what Chapter 4 does.

## 6. The Calibration-Based Approach (Chapter 4)

The single most important insight from Chapter 4:

> *"It is difficult to measure the system parameters accurately. Instead, the system is calibrated using a standard VLSI step height."* — Chapter 4 §4.3.1

This means you don't need θ, projection-arm M, or the internal projector parameter `a`. The "tilt-flip trick" of §4.3.1 computes the inverse pattern from calibration data alone:

```
1. Project uniform fringes onto flat reference
2. Capture phase-shifted frames, extract unwrapped phase φ₁
3. Fit a tilted plane:        P(x, y) = m_x·x + m_y·y + c
4. Subtract tilt:             curvature = φ₁ − P
5. Flip sign:                 inverse_curvature = −curvature
6. Add tilt back:             φ₂ = P + inverse_curvature = 2·P − φ₁
```

φ₂ is then used to generate the pre-distorted projection pattern (Eq. 4-5). When projected through the same biased system, the pre-distortion and the system bias cancel. Result: clean uniform fringes (Eq. 4-9), regardless of what the underlying system parameters actually are.

Chapter 4 also covers:
- Repeating the bias measurement 50× with phase offsets and surface position changes for averaging
- Vertical (height) calibration: measure a known step, compute λ_eq empirically
- Lateral (xy) calibration: image a known grid scale, compute µm/pixel

## 7. State of the Existing Notebook

The user's `Fringe_Projection_Python.ipynb` already implements the math:
- Phase shifting, unwrapping, tilt fitting, tilt-flip correction, height reconstruction
- Recovers a synthetic Gaussian to ~10⁻⁵ precision

### What's missing
The notebook **doesn't simulate the full physical loop**. It writes φ₁ and φ₃ as analytical formulas directly, rather than simulating "pattern in → projector distorts it → distorted pattern out."

The minimal fix is a 3-line function:

```python
def project(input_phase):
    bias = (2 * np.pi / p1) * (X**2 * np.tan(theta) / a)
    return input_phase - bias
```

With this, projecting φ₂ through the function produces a clean uniform ramp — validating the full inverse grating method end-to-end **before any hardware is touched**.

## 8. Open Questions for Supervisor

Non-blocking — proceed on best assumptions and ask in parallel.

1. Is the upgraded projector telecentric?
2. What's the simplified λ_eq formula for the hybrid case?
3. Software post-correction or hardware pre-correction?
4. Number of phase-shift steps (4 vs. 8)?
5. Calibration artifacts available in lab?
6. GUI framework preference?

## 9. Theoretical Insights From the Walkthrough

The user worked through the chapter step by step and these were the conceptual landmarks:

- **u₃ in Eq. 2-41 is a sensor-side displacement** caused by object height. We don't measure u₃ directly — we measure phase, which is a sensor-side displacement encoded as a cosine argument shift.

- **The /M factor in Eq. 2-49 is simple specifically because the system is telecentric** — telecentric magnification is constant everywhere, so position-dependent stretching factors collapse. In non-telecentric systems, M varies with position; the chapter handles this with the `(1 − x₁·tan θ/a)` factor.

- **`x₁` is a coordinate on the projector's grating plane**. For a digital projector (DLP), x₁ is just the column index of each pixel relative to the optical axis.

- **Once the system is set up, θ is fixed.** Only x₁ varies across the projected pattern, and h(x₁) varies across the surface. This is why p₂(x₁) varies across the inverse grating but everything else is constant.

- **Eq. 4-7 is structurally Eq. 4-2 with the curvature sign flipped** — that's literally what the tilt-flip trick does.

- **Custom grating is needed for this project** because the projector is non-telecentric. Telecentric viewing only handles the camera side; projector-side bias requires either a telecentric projector or the inverse grating method.

## 10. Project Conversations Note

- User had a friend building a separate **Three.js 3D simulation** of the lab geometry (separate from the Python pipeline). The `Projector_Geometry_Summary.docx` was prepared for that collaborator. The Three.js work is **complementary**, not duplicative — it's a geometric visualization of the physical setup; the Python work is the operational measurement pipeline.

---

## 11. Resolved During the Conversation

- Identified all hardware (camera, lens, projector models)
- Confirmed system is **hybrid** (telecentric viewing, non-telecentric projection)
- Confirmed inverse grating method (§2.3.4.3 / Chapter 4) is the project's chosen approach
- Measured projector lens position; ~0° vertical optical offset confirmed
- Computed practical FOV, pixel pitch, magnification numbers
- Identified the gap in the existing notebook (missing `project()` function)
- Established that hardware-free development is the right starting approach until mounting hardware arrives
- Built a roadmap (Stages 0–6) with this-week to-do items

## 12. Tone & Style Notes

The user prefers:
- **Short concrete answers** over long expositions
- Step-by-step physical reasoning, not equation walls
- Honest disagreement when something's hand-wavy
- One thing at a time
- Practical code suggestions kept minimal

# Fringe Projection Project — Context for Claude Code

> **Read this file first at the start of every session.** It captures the full project context, hardware setup, theoretical framework, design decisions, and roadmap. Treat it as the source of truth until told otherwise.

## 1. What This Project Is

A **fringe projection 3D measurement system** being built in a research lab. The goal is to recover the height profile of test objects by projecting sinusoidal fringe patterns onto a surface, capturing phase-shifted images with a camera, and processing the captured fringes to extract a height map.

The project is based on **Chapter 2 (theory)** and **Chapter 4 (practical implementation)** of a thesis by the thesis author. The thesis lives in the `reference/` folder.

The user's deliverables:
1. A **Python user interface (UI)** that controls the experiment end-to-end (pattern generation, projection, capture, calibration, processing, visualization).
2. The **math/processing core** behind the UI.
3. Eventually: **integration with real hardware** in the lab.

The user has an existing Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/Fringe_Projection_Python.ipynb`) that implements an end-to-end synthetic simulation. **It works** — recovers a Gaussian bump from simulated fringes with mean error ~10⁻⁵ after DC alignment. The notebook is the starting point for refactoring, not a thing to start over.

## 2. Hardware Setup

### Currently in the lab (confirmed)

**Camera: FLIR Blackfly S BFS-U3-13Y3M-C** (SN: 26048170)
- Monochrome, USB3 Vision, global shutter
- 1280 × 1024 pixels at 4.8 µm pitch
- Up to 170 fps
- 1/2" sensor format (active area 6.14 × 4.92 mm)
- C-mount
- **SDK: Spinnaker / PySpin** (Python bindings)
- Sold by Edmund Optics as stock #36-451

**Camera lens: Edmund Optics #58-259** (TECHSPEC GoldTL Telecentric)
- 0.09× magnification
- 132–182 mm working distance (focusable)
- < 0.2° telecentricity
- 1/2" sensor format
- **Confirmed telecentric — viewing-arm perspective bias is hardware-eliminated**

**Projector (placeholder unit, will be upgraded): Pico Genie Impact 2.0 Plus Elite**
- DLP projector
- 854 × 480 (FWVGA) native resolution
- 1.2:1 throw ratio, 16:9 aspect ratio
- 55 × 55 × 55 mm cube
- **Non-telecentric** consumer optics
- HDMI input (acts as a second display)
- **Auto-keystone confirmed OFF**
- Confirmed projector is **NOT telecentric** — projection-arm perspective bias must be corrected via inverse grating method

### Pending hardware

- **Upgraded projector** (more capable than Pico Genie). Telecentric or not — **status unknown**, user will confirm with supervisor.
- **Mounting hardware** (kinematic stages / rigid mounts). Until this arrives, real measurements aren't viable; calibration depends on stable repeatable geometry.
- **Optical breadboard** for stable component layout.
- **Calibration artifacts**: flat reference (gauge block / optical flat), step-height standard, calibrated grid scale (lateral).

### Derived parameters (camera arm)

- **Field of view on test surface:** ~68 × 55 mm
- **Pixel pitch on test surface:** ~53 µm/pixel
- **Imaging-arm magnification (M, modern convention):** 0.09×
- **Imaging-arm magnification (M, chapter convention = 1/0.09):** ~11.1×
  - ⚠️ The chapter uses the inverse convention; be careful when plugging into chapter equations.

### Pico Genie geometry (measured, in projector body frame)

Body frame: origin at front-bottom-left corner of cube; +X right, +Y into body, +Z up.

- Lens center: (X = 21 mm, Y ≈ 1–2 mm recess, Z = 45 mm)
- **Vertical optical offset: 0°** (confirmed — image center collinear with lens optical axis)
- **Horizontal optical offset: ~12° tentative** (likely setup misalignment; to be re-measured with proper mounting)
- Image at 30 cm throw: ~25 cm wide × ~14 cm tall (matches throw ratio + aspect ratio prediction)

## 3. System Configuration: HYBRID

The system is **hybrid**:
- **Viewing arm: telecentric** (locked by Edmund Optics lens — cannot be turned off)
- **Projection arm: non-telecentric** (Pico Genie; future projector status unknown)

The camera arm therefore contributes essentially zero perspective bias. **All measurable bias comes from the projection arm.**

### Method choice

The thesis describes three correction strategies (Chapter 2):

| Section | Method | Used here? |
|---|---|---|
| §2.3.4.1 | Recognize perspective effect (no correction) | No — the problem to fix |
| §2.3.4.2 | Telecentric lenses on **both** arms | Partial — only viewing arm is telecentric |
| §2.3.4.3 | **Project a custom pre-distorted (inverse) grating** | **YES — chapter explicitly says this is what the project does** |

Combined with the telecentric viewing lens already canceling camera-side bias, the inverse grating cancels the remaining projection-side bias. End result: clean uniform fringes on the surface, clean phase measurement.

If the upgraded projector turns out to be telecentric, the inverse grating reduces gracefully to a uniform pattern (no harm done).

### Critical insight — system parameters not needed

Chapter 4 §4.3.1 states explicitly:

> *"It is difficult to measure the system parameters accurately. Instead, the system is calibrated using a standard VLSI step height."*

> *"...the new projected phase map, φ₂, can be determined from the measured phase map φ₁ by subtracting the tilt from φ₁, multiplying the result by -1, and then adding the tilt back. This allows us to correct for the system biases in real time without the need for measuring the system parameters precisely."*

This means **θ, projection-arm M, and the internal projector parameter `a` are NOT required.** Calibration on a flat reference absorbs all of them automatically.

### Key chapter equations

| Equation | What it is | Used in module |
|---|---|---|
| 2-44 | Full intensity equation `I(x₁, h)` (general non-telecentric) | `synthetic_fringes` (forward model) |
| 2-46 / 2-47 | Phase → height + λ_eq (general) | `reconstruction` |
| 2-52 | Simplified λ_eq (symmetric telecentric, sanity check) | `reconstruction` |
| 2-54 | Inverse grating period p₂(x₁) — theoretical reference | `pattern_generator` |
| 2-57 | Phase → height with inverse grating | `reconstruction` |
| **4-2 → 4-7** | **Tilt-flip trick — operational core** | **`calibration`** |
| 4-9 / 4-10 | Clean phase on object after bias correction | reference |

## 4. State of the Existing Notebook

`notebooks/Fringe_Projection_Python.ipynb` already implements the end-to-end synthetic pipeline. **It works.**

### Already implemented (Cells 1–19)
- Grid/parameter setup
- Forward-model simulation of biased phase φ₁ (Taylor approximation of Eq. 2-44)
- 4-step phase shifting
- Phase extraction via `arctan2`
- Phase unwrapping with `np.unwrap`
- Tilt fitting and bias extraction
- Tilt-flip computation of correction phase φ₂ (Cell 10)
- Synthetic Gaussian object simulation
- End-to-end height reconstruction with mean error ~10⁻⁵

### ⚠️ What's missing (gap to close in Stage 1)

The notebook does **NOT** simulate the full physical projection loop. Specifically, it writes φ₁ and φ₃ directly as analytical formulas rather than simulating "pattern in → projector distorts it → distorted pattern out."

The minimal addition needed:

```python
def project(input_phase):
    """Simulates non-telecentric projector adding perspective bias."""
    bias = (2 * np.pi / p1) * (X**2 * np.tan(theta) / a)
    return input_phase - bias
```

With this, projecting φ₂ through the function should produce a clean uniform ramp. That validates the full inverse-grating method end-to-end before any real hardware is touched.

## 7. Design Principles

### 7.1 — Geometry abstraction
All system-specific math lives behind a `Geometry` interface so the rest of the pipeline doesn't care which configuration is in use:

```python
class Geometry(Protocol):
    def equivalent_wavelength(self) -> float: ...
    def height_to_phase(self, h: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray: ...
    def phase_to_height(self, psi: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray: ...
    def projected_pattern(self, p: float, phase_shift: float, shape: tuple) -> np.ndarray: ...
    def forward_intensity(self, h: np.ndarray, p: float, phase_shift: float) -> np.ndarray: ...
```

Concrete implementations: `HybridGeometry` (default for this project), `SymmetricTelecentricGeometry`, `NonTelecentricGeometry`.

### 7.2 — No hardware coupling in math modules
`pattern_generator`, `synthetic_fringes`, `phase_shifting`, `unwrapping`, `calibration`, `reconstruction`, `geometry` should be **pure Python with no hardware dependencies**. They take/return NumPy arrays. This means:
- They can be tested entirely with synthetic data.
- They are reusable (the user's friend is building a separate Three.js geometric simulation — these same math functions support that work).

### 7.3 — Hardware behind a thin interface
When hardware is added, define abstractions like:

```python
class Camera(Protocol):
    def capture(self, exposure_ms: float) -> np.ndarray: ...

class Projector(Protocol):
    def display(self, pattern: np.ndarray) -> None: ...
```

Initial implementations: `MockCamera` (returns synthetic frames), `MockProjector` (saves PNGs / writes to extended display). Real implementations: `FLIRCamera` (PySpin wrapper), `RealProjector` (extended display).

## 8. Open Questions for Supervisor (not blocking)

1. Is the upgraded projector telecentric? If yes, the hybrid case collapses to symmetric-telecentric.
2. What's the simplified `λ_eq` formula for the hybrid case (telecentric viewing + non-telecentric projection)? Or use empirical calibration per Chapter 4?
3. Software post-correction (subtract bias from measurement) or hardware pre-correction (project inverse pattern)? Both are mathematically equivalent. Chapter uses pre-correction.
4. How many phase-shift steps (4 or 8)? Notebook uses 4; chapter uses 8.
5. What calibration artifacts are available in the lab vs. need to be ordered?
6. GUI framework preference?

---

## 9. Coordinate / Sign Conventions

- **Projector body frame**: origin at front-bottom-left corner of cube; +X right, +Y into body, +Z up.
- **Wall plane** at projection: Y = −D where D is throw distance.
- **Image arrays**: NumPy convention `(H, W)` = (rows, cols). When mapping to physical X (horizontal) and Y (vertical), array axis 0 = vertical (Y), axis 1 = horizontal (X).
- **Phase units**: radians.
- **Length units**: SI in equations; pixels in synthetic notebook. Document units explicitly in every function docstring.

## 10. User Notes for Working with Claude Code

- Prefers **short concrete answers** over long expositions.
- Learns by analogy and step-by-step physical reasoning.
- Pushes back on hand-wavy assumptions (correctly).
- Comfortable with Python, decent experience.
- Has Claude Code, Git, Conda, MATLAB, VS Code, Node.js installed.
- Wants to validate algorithm thoroughly in simulation before touching real hardware.

When refactoring, work **one module at a time**, write a small test that confirms the module reproduces the notebook's behavior, and commit before moving on.

## 11. Suggested Starting Tasks for Claude Code

In rough priority order. Do them with the user, one at a time:

1. Read this file, the conversation summary, and the notebook. Summarize back to confirm understanding.
2. Set up the package structure (`src/` with empty stub modules per the layout above).
3. Refactor Cells 1–2 of the notebook into `geometry.py` (system parameters + `HybridGeometry` class).
4. Refactor Cell 3 (forward model) into `synthetic_fringes.py`. **Add the missing `project()` function.**
5. Refactor Cells 5–7 into `phase_shifting.py` and `unwrapping.py`.
6. Refactor Cell 18 into `reconstruction.py`.
7. Refactor Cells 8–11 into `calibration.py` (tilt-flip trick).
8. Write `tests/test_pipeline_synthetic.py` reproducing the notebook's end-to-end Gaussian recovery.
9. Once the test passes, the math core is done — start the GUI.

For each module, write **clear docstrings** with units, dimensions, and references to the relevant chapter equation (e.g., `# Implements Eq. 4-7 from Samara Chapter 4`).
